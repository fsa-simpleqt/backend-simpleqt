Proxyway takes the private nature of your information seriously, therefore, this Privacy Notice describes how we handle the personal data of the visitors of our website.

By reading through the content posted on https://proxyway.com/, you are deemed to have accepted to be bound by this Privacy Notice.

We  may collect your name and email address when you input it into the “Find the Best Service” form, send us an email at [email protected] or leave a comment on our website. We may process this piece of data either based on our legitimate interests of communicating with you or on some other existing legal grounds when we have such.

Our website collects access logs (e. g. IP address, browser used, etc.). Access logs are used to prevent cyber threats, thus, the basis for handling this data would be our legitimate interests of information security.

It is also our legitimate interest for Proxyway to be seen on the market. Therefore, our website contains social sharing features, such as the Twitter “tweet” and Facebook “Like” buttons. These widgets may collect some data (such as your IP address plus which page you are visiting) and may set some cookies to enable the features.

The use of cookies is standard on the Internet. They are small text files sent by us to your computer or mobile device, and they help our website function. You can choose whether to accept or block cookies through your browser settings. You could decide to delete cookies as well. All major browsers allow users to choose their cookie settings.

Proxyway enables visitors to leave comments. You grant us a nonexclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, transferable license: (a) to reproduce, modify, distribute, publicly perform, publicly display, and use the deliverables, in each case without any restrictions; and (b) to sublicense any or all such rights to third parties. Sharing confidential information is not allowed in our comment sections. Also please make sure that the purpose of your comment is to interact with others in a constructive way. Hatred, harassment, fraudulent and other illegal activities are not allowed. We hold the right to delete such comments.

We hold the data for a period that is required to fulfil our obligations (e. g. record keeping) and to be able to establish a claim or defend ourselves from one.

To the extent prohibited by applicable law, we do not allow the use of our website by anyone younger than 16 years old. If you learn that anyone younger than 16 has unlawfully provided us with personal data, please contact us and we will take steps to delete such information.

Under applicable data protection legislation, in certain circumstances, you have rights concerning your personal data.

You might have a right to: (1) request a copy of all your personal data that we store; (2) request deletion of your data; (3) restrict, or object to, the processing of your personal data; (4) correct any inaccurate or incomplete personal data we hold on you.

You could get in touch with the applicable authorities regarding our processing of your personal data as well. However, we believe that together we can solve any issues that may arise, so we would be very grateful, if you contact us at [email protected] first.

We may share some of the data with our third-party service providers, such as our email service provider. This might mean that your data may be transferred to other countries than the one you reside in. Rest assured that we monitor our providers to ensure that they do business in accordance with the data protection standards.

Our website may contain links to and from other websites. If you follow any of the links, please note that these websites have their own privacy notices and terms of use and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these other websites. Be sure to check the documentation before submitting any personal data to these websites.

DNT is the concept that has been promoted by regulatory authorities, in particular the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), for the Internet industry to develop and implement a mechanism for allowing internet users to control the tracking of their online activities across websites. At the moment we do not respond to DNT signals because no DNT standard has been adopted yet.

We take data protection very seriously. We work hard to protect the information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access or disclosure. Nonetheless, given the nature of communications and information processing technology, we cannot guarantee that information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others.

You and Proxyway agree that the laws of the State of Delaware, excluding conflict of laws rules, shall exclusively govern any dispute relating to this Privacy Notice. You and Proxyway agree that claims and disputes can be litigated only in the courts of State of Delaware and of the United States of America located in such state.

This version of Privacy Notice is effective from November 11th, 2019. We will review and may update this Privacy Notice from time to time. Any changes to this Privacy Notice will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Notice.
