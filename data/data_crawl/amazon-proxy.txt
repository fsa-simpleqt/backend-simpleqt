There are two main proxy types that work best with Amazon:

If you‚Äôre interested in scraping data from Amazon but want to avoid the hassle of managing proxies and dealing with CAPTCHAs, many providers on this list offer¬†web scraping APIs¬†optimized for this e-commerce platform.

We took 8 established proxy providers. We then put them through extensive tests by repeatedly connecting to Amazon using hundreds of connection requests at once. We examined the proxy success rate and response time on Amazon. We considered the performance results alongside the provider‚Äôs features, pricing, and general user experience to make the final decision.

Amazon is the largest e-retailer in the world. Its pricing and product information is very valuable for every business. You can use it to scrape Amazon reviews, prices, and other data to conduct market analysis and gain a competitive edge over other retailers.

But Amazon is very vigilant about protecting its data, and you can only do so much with one IP address. If you start abusing the website, you‚Äôll quickly get blocked. That‚Äôs why you need proxies to trick Amazon into believing it‚Äôs being accessed by different ‚Äì and ideally real-looking ‚Äì people.

Dedicated datacenter proxies are both cheaper and faster. However, they are easy to spot. Amazon will quickly notice such proxies and blocked them or feed you false data. Another big drawback is that datacenter IPs come in groups called subnets. If one proxy gets banned, it can take up to 264 IPs with it.

For these reasons, you should choose residential proxies for Amazon scraping. These are IPs used by real internet users, so they‚Äôre much harder for Amazon to block. Residential proxies often use backconnect servers which are easy to set up and¬†rotate. This lets you make hundreds of connection requests without getting banned.

Yes, you can. Just make sure your Amazon proxy provider offers good location coverage. It should include not only USA and the United Kingdom but countries all over the world such as Australia, India, and Japan. You should also be able to target those specific locations and not simply have them in a general proxy pack.

Location targeting is important not only for web scraping. It‚Äôs crucial if you want a proxy for Amazon Prime video for watching¬†geo-restricted content¬†on your device. Just make sure you‚Äôre not using HTTP proxies for Amazon Prime because you will get the ‚ÄúHTTP proxy not supported‚Äù error.

City targeting is not necessary for scraping Amazon: local Amazon websites operate country-wide.

There are at least a dozen programs for automated Amazon scraping. Some of the most popular ones are Chrome browser extensions like Web Scraper, Data Scraper, and Scraper. Other applications that allow scraping Amazon are Scrapy, ParseHub, OutWitHub, FMiner, Octoparse, and Web Harvey.

Choose your scraper depending on your needs. Some businesses build their own scraping solutions, but that requires the know-how and resources not everyone has. No matter the app, you can only use it to its full potential in tandem with proxies.

If you don‚Äôt want to bother with writing scraping scripts or setting up specialized software, several premium proxy providers can do the heavy lifting for you. For example, Oxylabs has E-Commerce Scraper API for heavy-duty data retrieval, and Bright Data offers data collection services.

Ive been looking for something like this, because scraping is hard. Is there an easy way to extrat data from amazon?

The more money you have, the easier it is. üôÇ If you‚Äôre loaded, simply get a data extraction service to do it for you. If you don‚Äôt need to scrape much data, you can try using a visual scraper like Octoparse.

So that‚Äôs what amazon proxy marketing is? Using proxies for setting up multiple accounts? I‚Äôve been reading on this and it‚Äôs confusing.

Despite its name, proxy marketing is unrelated to proxies. It‚Äôs handing out items for reviews.

Hey guys! Thanks for the amazing information you provide for us. One thing is not clear to me, though. Which proxy service would be the best way to go in terms of managing multiple seller accounts on ecommerce websites? Static residential proxy, ISP, ‚Ä¶

Hi Jacob. I‚Äôd suggest static residential or mobile proxies. You can also use residential proxy servers if you have some experience with them.
