Instagram bots and scrapers let you quickly create and grow multiple accounts, automatically engage with your followers, and scrape valuable data, such as hashtags or user profiles. Coupled with Instagram proxies, they provide a powerful – and profitable – way to expand your social media reach and make some money off the platform.

Nowadays, Instagram is very strict about bots and scrapers. But automation is still possible. What is certain is that you’ll need a good Instagram proxy server to avoid your IP address getting blocked. This page will teach you more about Instagram proxies and help you choose the best proxy provider for your Instagram bot.

The Best Instagram Proxies of 2024 – Quick Summary:

If you prefer video, we have one as well:

An Instagram proxy is a proxy server optimized specifically for Instagram. Nowadays, that means two things:

Otherwise, Instagram proxies are the same as your regular proxy IPs. You can find them on most sites of proxy providers that offer proxies for sneaker copping, Youtube, Craigslist, and so on.

From best to worst:

And as always, never settle for bad service.

The best overall Instagram proxies.

Smartproxy is our editor’s choice, and for good reasons – its proxies are fast and highly scalable. During our latest Proxy Market Research, the mobile proxies reached an average success rate of 97.37%. These addresses come from a pool of 10 million IPs. You can target 130 locations and over 700 ASNs.

The provider also spans a huge – 40 million – residential proxy network with locations worldwide. During our tests, these IPs showed an almost perfect success rate and response time. 

Smartproxy’s ISP proxies come from a pool of 16,000 static addresses in the US. They rotate with every request, but it’s possible to create static sessions that don’t expire. So, it’s a good choice for Instagram account management.

The provider offers great customer support and plenty of content on Instagram automation. The services are simple to use and don’t cost much for what you get. Additional perks include an anti-detect browser, which you can use free of charge with any of the proxy services.

But Smartproxy isn’t perfect for everything. With its mobile and residential proxies, you can create sticky sessions for up to 30 mins, which isn’t ideal for creating multiple accounts. And ISP proxies only support locations in the US.

Mobile proxies with flexible filtering options.

SOAX’s mobile proxy pool has 3.5M IP addresses on 3G and 4G networks. These proxies showed great results – an average of a 98.22% success rate. 

The provider also controls around 5 million residential proxies in over 150 countries and 100,000 ISP addresses in the US. 

SOAX has very flexible filtering options for its mobile and residential proxies. It allows selecting country and region, city, and ASN. And that’s the touchstone for Instagram account management since most social media platforms only tolerate addresses with similar parameters. 

SOAX’s mobile and residential proxies rotate from 90 to 600 seconds, and you can specify custom duration. The ISP addresses can hold sessions for up to 24 hours.

There are a few drawbacks: you’ll have to whitelist your IP address, and you get a limited number of ports with each subscription.

Starts from $99 for 15 GB ($6.6/GB) and 300 ports

Instagram proxies with the most features.

Bright Data is one of the largest proxy providers, with a pool of 7 million mobile proxies. These addresses are rarely blocked (avg. success rate: 98.06%). The provider gives you enough freedom to select a mobile carrier and use as many IPs as you want at once.

Bright Data also controls a pool of 72 million rotating and 700,000 static residential proxies worldwide. The mobile and residential proxies cover any country and thousands of cities with carrier targeting. The ISP addresses include 50 locations up to the city level. 

With Bright Data, you’ll get flexible IP rotation options: rotation every request, as long as your IP is available, or further customize with its Proxy Manager. So, you can greatly manipulate your IPs to match your Instagram use case – from web scraping to account management.

The drawbacks? Well, Bright Data considers features like ASN targeting as premium and charges double, whereas other providers offer it for free. The whole user experience can be confusing at times. And its mobile proxies are pretty slow.

Fast ISP proxies with complete self-service.

Even though Webshare doesn’t offer mobile IPs, it controls an impressive aggregate of 100,000 ISP proxies in 5 locations. Our tests showed that these proxies are fast and they reached an average success rate of 91.84%.

You can get shared, dedicated, and semi-dedicated proxies in lists of static addresses suitable for Instagram account management. If you want to scrape publicly available data, you can rotate these addresses for free with every connection request. 

The provider also has one of the cheaper residential proxies in the market, with 30 million addresses worldwide. 

Both services come with complete self-service and flexible plans. You can select the number of proxies you want, their bandwidth limit, and replace IPs automatically anywhere between several minutes and a month. 

However, the price won’t be that favorable if you want to add features like network priority, refresh or replace proxies. Additionally, the customer service is available only via email.

ISP proxies with flexible targeting in the US.

NetNut advertises only one million mobile addresses, but our tests showed it has more unique IPs than some of the larger alternatives. The proxies reached a success rate of 95.68%.

These addresses rotate with every request, but you can hold sticky sessions. By paying extra, you can unlock features like state or city, and get the ability to whitelisted IPs. 

NetNut also sells both static and rotating residential proxies. The rotating residential IPs cover over 150 countries and have a pool of 52 million monthly IPs. The static proxies come from a network of 1 million addresses that you can filter up to the city level. NetNut allows keeping the same IP for as long as it remains available or, in the case of ISP proxies, indefinitely.

On the downside, three in four proxies in NetNut’s unfiltered pool weren’t mobile. Also, they’re very slow.

Yes, though it’s much harder than it used to be. Marketers still use Instagram automation software, but they have to do things more carefully than before. You will also have to invest into quality proxies and take things slowly. Don’t expect to follow thousands of pages or scrape millions of results per day.

You can buy Instagram proxies from any of the providers on our list. We include various options for account management, scraping, and other tasks.

Yes and no. Last year Instagram hardened its security, so it’s become very hard to use a private proxy for Instagram bots and scraping software. But certain bots like Jarvee allow you to set up so-called “scraper accounts”. Their whole purpose is to help you gather data (so, relevant profiles or hashtags) for further automation tasks. Some marketers have tried using private proxies with such accounts and got satisfactory results.

Is doing automatic instagram likes and comments safe with proxies? Datacenter or Reisdential?

Well, it’s an activity that Instagram hates and constantly tries to overcome – so I wouldn’t really call it safe. But your best bet would be to use residential or mobile proies for that.

I want to start a travel instagram profile, and it seems that there is a huge competition. I want make the competitor analysis like which hashtags they use, how many followers they have and so on. Does instagram allow scraping? Because there is like 5…

Instagram doesn’t really allow scraping it – it’s against the terms of service. But people do it anyway.
