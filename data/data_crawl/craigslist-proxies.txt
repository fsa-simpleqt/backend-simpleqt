Craigslist proxies change your IP address to make you appear as a different person. They’re very helpful if you want to unblock Craigslist, scrape its postings, or post multiple ads to various locations and without blocks. This page lists some of the best Craigslist proxy providers we’ve encountered during years of testing. They cover various needs and price points, so you should be able to find the right service for you.

The Best Craigslist Proxy Providers – Quick Summary:

You can reap the benefits of Craigslist proxies in many ways; however, the most common uses are posting in different countries and cities than your own locale, bulk posting, and scraping. 

Craigslist operates in 700 cities and 70 countries. As you probably already know, it caters to local communities. That’s why requests from different countries and even cities are restricted. As a result, you won’t be able to post anything on the New York board if you live, say, in the UK. If you try, you’ll find Craigslist blocking your IP address.

Does that mean your business should forgo Craigslist as a sales platform? Not necessarily. Simply use a Craigslist proxy server, and it will make you look like a local. 

Did you know that Craigslist actually allows bulk posting? There are only a few small details. To use the Craigslist API, you have to:

Everyone else is limited to one advertisement in one category every 48 hours. Pretty disappointing, right? Don’t worry, there’s a way around it. You’ll need a Craigslist proxy server to post multiple ads successfully.

However, even with proxies, you need to keep some things in mind. Use separate proxies for separate postings. Don’t make posts at the same time; they should be at least slightly different and without spammy words such as “free” or “weight loss.” 

Unlike other online platforms, Craigslist does not have an API for data retrieval. In other words, you can’t collect data from it automatically – you’d effectively have to copy it by hand. Thankfully, you can 1) build your a Craigslist scraper with any programming language of your choice and integrate proxies or 2) go with commercial web scraping or proxy-based APIs that already include proxies. Most of the providers on this list offer both – proxies and web scraping tools. 

Without a proxy server, Craigslist will quickly detect an unusual number of requests and block your IP from the website. With good residential proxies you’ll be able to scrape Craigslist at scale without getting blocked.

What data do people want from Craigslist exactly? Some users scrape Craigslist to keep an eye on items that are being sold (tickets, for example). Others use scrapers to find something for personal use. Businesses use Craigslist proxies to retrieve website data so that they can generate leads. Usually, they go through the postings and collect email addresses.

Here’s a few tips for getting your Craigslist proxies right the first time:

When it comes to money, we all love to save a buck or two when the opportunity appears. But no matter how tempted you are to give free proxies a shot, we advise against it. Free proxies are highly problematic. 

First of all, there are hardly any free services on the market that would work well with Craigslist. Another thing worth noting is that free proxies don’t guarantee that they are safe to use. Still unconvinced? You can read more on the topic here. 

The best balance between features and price.

Smartproxy has a network of 40 million residential IPs. You can get proxies from 195 locations and target them by state or city. They rotate with every connection request or up to 10 minutes and 30 minutes.

The provider’s pricing is more approachable than its main competitors. But that’s not the only thing Smartproxy has to offer. Its user-friendly approach allows you to navigate through the documentation easily, and the performance exceeds expectations.

The main drawback is limited targeting options (no carrier or ASN targeting). However, if you’re looking for residential IPs at a budget-friendly price, Smartproxy is an easy choice to make.

Features:

Pricing:

Starts from $7 for 1 GB. 3-day free trial available.

The most versatile provider.

With a giant pool of 72M residential IPs, Bright Data is one of the largest proxy providers in the market. It offers a wide range of features and precise targeting options (such as ASN and ZIP code). 

Additionally, Bright Data has a number of helpful tools to control your proxies, such as its open source proxy manager, which allows you to rotate your proxies however you like. 

On the downside, Bright Data isn’t beginner friendly – it’s very complex to use and pricey. But developers will find the service very powerful. 

Features: 

Pricing:

Starts from $8.40 for 1 GB. 7-day free trial for businesses, 3-day refund for individuals.

Very flexible rotation & location targeting options.

SOAX has 5 million residential addresses in over 150 locations. It offers precise location targeting options for posting on different city boards. You can rotate your proxies with every request, from 90s to 600s, or choose custom duration.

In terms of price, SOAX is among the cheaper options. In addition, it offers an attractive dashboard and a customer success manager. 

But there are some concerns like obligatory IP whitelisting and a limited number of ports with all the plans. Additionally, you won’t be able to pay as you go. 

Features:

Pricing:

From $99 for 15 GB ($6.6/GB) and 300 ports. 3-day trial for $1.99 available.

Affordable proxies with flexible targeting.

Infatica caters to businesses and offers a network of 10 million peer-to-peer residential IPs. You can target any of 150 locations up to ASN level. It has relatively flexible IP rotation – with every request, or between 5 and 60 minutes.

In terms of the user interface, Infatica’s panel isn’t the most convenient to use, but it includes all the necessary features. And we were pleasantly surprised with its customer support – fast and thorough responses.

Overall, Infatica has difficulties matching top services in user experience, proxy network size, or features. For example, you won’t be able to pay as you go or find API access. But its rates scale very well for bulk use. 

Features:

Pricing:

Starts from $96 for 8 GB ($12/GB). 3-day trial for $1.99 available.

Residential proxies with non-expiring traffic.

Rayobyte sells residential proxies in over 150 countries with the option to filter individual cities. Its pricing system lets you purchase a specific amount of traffic, which remains available until you’ve used it. 

The starting rates for Rayobyte’s residential proxies rival premium providers steep, but once you buy over 50 GBs, they drop significantly. So, it makes sense to buy more traffic in advance. If you encounter any issues while using the service, Rayobyte’s customer support reps are ready to help you out 24/7. 

The rotation settings are not very flexible; the residential proxies rotate with each request, or you can keep them for as long as they’re available, with no option to set custom intervals. What’s more, our tests showed that the proxies were pretty slow.

Features:

Pricing:

Starts from $15 for 1 GB. 2-day free trial with 50 MB.

Cheap proxies with flexible filtering options.

IPRoyal is the cheapest residential proxy provider on this list. It controls a significantly smaller – 2 million – proxy pool than the competition. But the service has flexible rotation and filtering options.

IPRoyal’s customer service is available 24/7, and the support reacts fast. You won’t have to commit to monthly plans, and the traffic won’t expire. 

Besides a relatively small proxy pool, the IPs aren’t the best performers. We’ve encountered more errors during our tests than with other providers, and the proxies were slow. But they’ll work with less demanding Craigslist tasks. 

Features:

Pricing:

Starts from $7 for 1 GB. No free trial.

Residential proxies for large-scale use.

NetNut is another provider that’s after larger clients. The service comes with 52 million monthly IPs and 150 countries to choose from. It includes city-level targeting and rotation every request or as long as the IP is available.

Over the years, NetNut greatly improved user experience, but it’s still very much in the making. Besides detailed usage statistics, don’t expect easy navigation or quick answers from customer support. Additionally, NetNut charges even more than premium providers and doesn’t have pay-as-you-go. But once you scale over 250 GBs, the price gets more favorable. 

Features:

Pricing:

Starts from $100 for 5 GBs ($20/GB) . 7-day free trial for companies.

A Craigslist proxy is an IP address you can use to hide your real IP addresses, scrape data from Craigslist, get around phone verification, make multiple posts, avoid location restrictions or stay anonymous.

You can buy them from any of the providers on our list. Most of them come with free trials or money-back guarantees, so you can try out their services without risk.

There can be multiple reasons. You might be trying to post more listings than Craigslist allows. Or if you’re scraping the platform, you might have made too many requests too quickly. Craigslist proxies can help overcome these issues and unblock your Craigslist IP address.

You can use proxies for that. They change your IP address and make Craigslist see you as a different person.
