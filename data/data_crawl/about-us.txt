Proxyway is a blog dedicated to the research and testing of the best proxy providers and giving an honest opinion about their service. It was started in 2018, when two tech-enthusiasts, Adam and Chris, met on Stack Overflow and started sharing their experiences and opinions about proxies.

Our mission is to inform and educate our readers – both regular people and tech geeks – about proxy services. We’re committed to delivering comprehensive reviews, detailed guides, and other high-quality content explaining the “hows” and “whys” of current proxy technology.

I’m a geek that has long been into tech of all kinds. I got into web development back in my teens, after creating my first personal blog. Eventually, web dev became by profession, and writing content is something I still enjoy. I’ve quit my full-time job to work as a freelancer and right now, Proxyway is my main focus. On my free time, I enjoy urban exploring, geocaching and learning languages.

For me it all started with looking for proxies to work around bans in my old workplace (we really needed that sweet YouTube time). Eventually, I started getting more and more into proxies and the technology behind it. And here I am now, a proxy tester, reviewer and content creator. Besides proxies, I love arguing on Reddit, cooking spicy Korean food and listening to weird European music.

I’m a caffeine-fuelled tech junkie living in the UK. For years, I have been working as a marketing manager for various tech companies with no real knowledge of how proxies even work. Up until I tried to cop my first pair of Yeezys. Now I spend most of my free time hunting for instacops and trying out new bots. When I’m not rambling about my favorite streetwear brands, I’m either curled up with a mystery novel or dancing at a rave.
