These days, all social media giants (Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, etc.) have imposed many limitations on how you can use their platforms. And they put a lot of effort into ensuring that no one can bypass and trick their systems. For example, there’s a limit on how many accounts you can create from one IP. Proxies help bypass these limitations.

If you’re here reading this, we assume that you have a goal to trick those systems for one reason or another (BlackHatWorld users have so many reasons, some of them seem crazy even for us.) We are here to help.

Social media proxies have pretty similar use cases. It doesn’t really matter whether it’s Instagram or Facebook. Every Facebook proxy user can come up with a different set of reasons for using them. Here some of the most popular ones:

It doesn’t matter if you need multiple accounts for work, business, or personal reasons – you’ll probably encounter an issue at some point. While Facebook allows switching from one account to another – it’s only if both accounts are set up in the same location, with the same IP. And sometimes this just doesn’t work.

Imagine that you’re hired to manage a Facebook account of a business that is located in the US. But you live in Japan. Well, Facebook’s transparency features allow everyone visiting the page to see where it’s managed from, and not seeing the United States would potentially look shady for a lot of people.

Back in the days, people used to create Facebook accounts in bulk to spam people. Not the most ethical use case, but it worked and brought results. Today, you can’t really do that anymore. What you can do, however, is create multiple accounts for the Facebook Business Manager. From what we’ve heard, this is where the real money lies nowadays.

Facebook tends to get banned by schools and workplaces. As many other social media platforms, it’s considered to be bad for your attention span. No one wants you to waste your precious time there. Well, except maybe you! So, you can use proxies to unblock Facebook and freely browse the platform again.

Software programs like Useviral offer powerful Facebook automation features. For example, you can schedule and auto-share posts, automatically change your cover-photo, reply to messages, create post variations with spintax tools and post them to multiple groups, and so on. Proxies help these programs run uninhibited and at full capacity.

Like all other major social media platforms, Facebook stores a lot of valuable data. This could be anything from URLs to posts or even profiles. However, there is no longer an API to automatically retrieve it. So, you either have to do it by hand, or use a Facebook scraper. You’ll need proxies for your scraper to work; otherwise, Facebook will quickly notice your actions and block your IP address.

Whether it’s actually legal to do it is another question. The company vehemently opposed Facebook scraping, and you must be careful not to violate the GDPR or CCCP laws. But it’s still something that can be done and many find worth doing.

It’s likely that if you are looking to purchase dedicated proxies for Facebook, you already know quite a bit about them, but here is a short list of some tips we’ve gathered:

Free proxies are never a good choice. We have a full length post on why this is the case. Here’s a short rundown:

Type? Mobile, then residential. Provider? We cover the best proxy services in the article. (Hint: It’s Smartproxy.)
