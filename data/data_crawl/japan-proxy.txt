Japan proxy servers help you unlock local content, even if you’re not in Japan. Use a Japan proxy to buy local goods at local prices, scrape data off Japanese websites and appear as if you are from the country. Not every proxy provider can give you a reliable pool of Japanese IP addresses. We strongly recommend these five proxy providers for their performance in our proxy tests.

We created this list only after extensively testing each proxy provider to ensure a good user experience.

We first measured performance: stability, connection speed, and success rate of a proxy in Japan. We did these tests by running 500 connections simultaneously. We found out that only these proxy providers can easily overcome performance issues with servers in Japan.

We then considered the providers for their features. We made sure they offer enough proxies in Japan, are good for scraping and other tasks. We also took into account their ease of use and quality of customer service.

These were the main criteria of how we ranked the best Japan proxy providers. Each provider on this list has its own unique features. But no matter which one you choose, they will let you browse anonymously with a Japanese IP and unblock localized content for data scraping.

These Japanese proxy servers will work on all operating systems, including desktops or tablets. Every provider in the list supplies users with real residential IP addresses, which are highly resistant to blocking.

Each provider has different documentations and setup flows. Most of the time, you will set up a connection through Japan in no time, because these proxy providers are quite advanced and always improving their user experience.

It would be nice to have free and unlimited access to a Japanese proxy IP. But free proxies almost always come at the risk of having your ID, financial details and personal information stolen from you. On top of that, you will be losing your privacy and anonymity since free Japan proxy providers will be able to track all your activity. They do this by spying on users to mine browsing patterns for targeted ads, or maybe even for potential hacking.

All 5 best Japan proxy service providers on this list are ethical, registered companies that have a reliable business partnership with their users. Trusting a premium proxy provider is the smart way to go.

A local proxy in Japan lets you access restricted, region-blocked content and buy exclusive products at the local price. If you’re running a business, Japan proxy IP providers open up the opportunity to create a market for yourself by letting you scrape data, access region-blocked marketing info, and even form a local social media presence.

Others might find Japanese proxies useful when buying retail goods, checking Japanese prices, news and local flight information or streaming services. Many people use these proxies for sneaker bots and buy limited edition clothes from BAPE and other Japanese stores.

It is perfectly legal to use a Japanese proxy server. Still, you should review a website’s terms of service if you use a proxy to access geo-blocked content or scrape public data from Japanese websites. What we can tell you is that criminal activity of any kind can be traced back to the user, even if you mask your IP with a Japan proxy.

Yes. You can scrape data privately, gather marketing intelligence to find a local target audience, or just to get past a banned IP address by using any Japan proxy service provider on this page.
