Most people use Indian proxies to unlock local content. By sending your connection requests through an Indian proxy server, you appear as if you are from India. This way you can reach websites that are available only to Indian users. Using proxies also lets you protect your IP address and identity. If you want to avoid IP bans and blocks when scraping, you no longer need Indian proxy lists, especially with providers offering rotating proxy services. Here are our top five picks for the best Indian proxy providers.

We ran a comprehensive series of tests to answer the big question: which Indian proxy server is the best? We evaluated connection speed, connection headers, and other details – including customer support quality – to choose only the most reliable and user-friendly proxy providers for Indian IP addresses. Every one of these proxy servers basically does the same thing: they mask you and your software from the rest of the web. The top-5 proxy services in India provide the cleanest and the most reliable IP addresses. Our research provides interesting key takeaways:

Yes, you can! Proxy services are not malicious tools; they are available legally and have many positive use cases. By using an India proxy server, you will appear as if you are based in India. Millions of people use proxies every day for browsing the internet, playing real-time games, and other activities. Using a proxy to connect to other parts of the internet is not a crime either. Just note that a proxy doesn’t make you invisible or invincible – there are ways to track you other than your IP address.

Yes! That’s one of the main reasons why people use Indian proxies. With an Indian Proxy, you’ll be able not only to watch local shows, read news, and buy items from places in India, but also scrape Indian websites. The last use case is especially attractive to businesses who want to get into or compete in the quickly-growing Indian market.
