It’s perfectly legal to use an Australia proxy server to access the internet as if you were located in Australia. That means you can use Australian proxies to access ABC and other Aussie news sites. Just know that Australia proxies won’t make you untraceable or invincible. Law enforcement can use other methods to track down internet users who hide behind anonymity services like proxies. An Australian IP address is only one piece of data that Australian police would use to track down a suspect.

Each provider on our list offers reliable access to geo-blocked Australian content. This includes Australian news, programs and scraping localized data sources. Most Australia proxy service providers also have large pools of IP addresses. This means that whenever one IP address gets blocked, you can simply rotate onto the next one and continue browsing as normal. If you’re gathering market intelligence and need to access local content, a proxy service is the best solution.
