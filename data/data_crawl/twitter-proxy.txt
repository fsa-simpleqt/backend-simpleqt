Twitter, now owned by X Corp., is very popular amongst social media managers. The platform can bring many business growth opportunities like meeting potential clients or simply expanding your target audience. But Twitter allows you to create and manage up to ten accounts from the same IP address. A bit harsh, right?

Social media platforms want to ensure that users play fair and square: no spamming, using hacks to grow your profile like following/unfollowing, or misusing the platform in some other suspicious way. If you violate any of the rules – game over. Twitter will ban your IP.

So, if you want to start the ball rolling on multiple Twitter account management, unblock the platform in your country, or simply scrape tweets for marketing insights, Twitter proxies are here to save the day. Paired with Twitter bots or an antidetect browser, they can boost your social media business.

The Best Twitter Proxy Providers – Quick Summary:

A Twitter proxy server is a middleman computer specially optimized to bypass restrictions imposed by Twitter. Instead of connecting you to the platform directly, it routes your connection through a different IP address, so you look like a different person when accessing the website.

There are few providers out there that sell specialized Twitter proxies. Today it means that the proxies are clean and not blocked on Twitter.

You can only have up to ten accounts linked to a single IP address on Twitter so that you won’t spam or misuse the platform. Twitter proxies can help here by changing your IP address, so you can assign a different IP for every account.

Twitter fans want to see updates and fresh content a few times per day. This can get tricky when you’re working alone with hundreds of profiles. And who wants to spend all their time online when there are ways around it? Social media managers use automation software like Hootsuite because amongst many things it helps automate retweets and schedule tweets. However, your bot will be worthless after a while without a proxy server because it’s easily detectable by the platform.

Juggling 500 accounts is hard, but imagine telling 500 clients their accounts have been suspended. You can see your money pouring down the drain. So, the best way to run multiple online identities is by using an antidetect browser and a Twitter proxy. Antidetect browsers spoof your digital fingerprint (yes, another way to identify you), and a proxy will change your IP and location.

Twitter is known as the king of NFTs – you can use a non-fungible token as your profile picture and even link your account to a crypto wallet. A Twitter bot can help you promote NFTs and get the best deal possible for your digital art. However, bots are just too fast, which means they look nothing like you. And that’s a kill switch for social media platforms – an immediate IP ban. So, if you want to put your best game to get those tokens flipping, you’ll need to pair your bot with a Twitter proxy.

It’s not a surprise that some schools or workplaces think that social media is bad for you. Well, unless your job is being a social media guru. Even some countries (China, Iran, North Korea, etc.) aren’t fans of the site because you can express your opinion too freely. Proxies help bypass these restrictions but look over your shoulder when accessing the platform. You don’t wanna get fired, right?

Like other social media platforms, Twitter has a lot of valuable information. You can scrape tweets, profiles, links, and other data you think is necessary for powering your marketing strategy. Twitter even has its public APIs for bots to use. However, if you need to scrape more data faster and don’t want to be restricted by the platform rules, you’ll need a rotating Twitter proxy to help you out; otherwise, you’ll send too many requests from a single IP and get a ban.

Premium choice for any Twitter use case.

If anyone can handle Twitter – it’s Bright Data. The provider has the largest residential and mobile proxy networks on this list. It offers an excellent success rate, proxy response time, and stability. And we can back up our words – we tested each product in our annual Proxy Market Research.

You can use Bright Data’s proxies with any Twitter use case – from multiple account management to web scraping. Both services cover locations worldwide and support up to carrier targeting (in the case of residential proxies – up to ZIP code). A cherry on top – Bright Data’s open-source proxy manager allows you to rotate the proxies however you like.

Is there anything to say against Bright Data? Sure. The service is developer-oriented, so newbies might find it too difficult to grasp. Besides, it’s probably the most expensive service out there, especially if we talk about residential proxies and all the premium features like carrier targeting. And to top that off – X Corp. filed a lawsuit against Bright Data concerning Twitter’s terms of service violations.

Proxies with flexible rotation for Twitter account management.

With around 5 million residential and 3.5M mobile proxies, SOAX maintains the balance between quality proxies and prices that don’t bite. Its service regularly checks the proxy pool and immediately removes abused IPs, so it always stays clean. In addition to that, you’ll get great customer support and extensive documentation that will guide you during your setup process.

SOAX stands out with flexible rotation and location targeting for Twitter account creation and management. The rotation options range from 90 to 600 seconds, with an ability to specify a custom duration. You can target worldwide countries, regions, cities, and ASNs.

However, some technical features might put you off: obligatory IP whitelisting and a limited number of ports for plans.

Starts from $99 for 15 GB ($6.6/GB) and 300 ports

Residential proxies for scraping Twitter at scale.

Rayobyte is perfect for those seeking proxies for large-scale Twitter scraping. 

The provider offers residential proxies with a competent set of features – over 150 locations, city-level targeting, and sticky sessions for as long as the IP is available. The best part about this service is that your traffic never expires. That means the GBs you have left will be as good as new after one month. The price per unit is really attractive after reaching 50 GBs of data.

You can also opt for mobile proxies. The service has fewer locations, but enough to tackle Twitter. You’ll get the same IP rotation settings as with residential proxies, but the traffic will expire after you use your monthly quota.

On the bad side of things, our tests weren’t that grateful to Rayobyte – both proxy types were very slow.

Cheap proxies, good for running a small Twitter business.

IPRoyal offers 2 million residential IPs and spans over 150 locations worldwide. The provider has flexible rotation control: you can choose sticky sessions between 1 second and 24 hours.

From the technical side, it allows both HTTPS and SOCKS connections. IPRoyal is a smart choice for Twitter projects on a budget, as its proxies are among the cheaper in the market.

But IPRoyal isn’t all good news. Its residential proxy pool is much smaller compared to alternatives. So, you should primarily consider it for smaller-scale projects. You can also buy IPRoyal’s mobile proxies, but we can’t vouch for the service because we didn’t test it.

Features:

Pricing:

Starts from $7 for 1 GB.
