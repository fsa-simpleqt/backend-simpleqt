We ran multiple tests to measure how fast and reliable each provider is. We tracked their connection speeds and success rates when connecting to localized Chinese content. We also considered if they can withstand high loads by running 500 connection requests at the same time.

Our final results combine the performance tests with such criteria like ease of use, pricing and customer support. Every provider on this list offers the best proxies on the market.

You can use a China proxy service with almost any device or software. The precise steps to set up proxies with any of them might vary. But in the end, Chinese proxies will route your connection through IPs that are actually located within China or Hong Kong. This ensures you are assigned a genuine Chinese IP address and won’t get blocked when trying to access Chinese content.

We strongly recommend to avoid free China proxies. You should only use a proxy service if you trust the person or company behind it, especially in China. Its owner can  intercept all data that flows through the server, potentially giving them access to your passwords and other sensitive information. And China is famous for surveillance. Remember: if you aren’t paying for a product, you are the product.

A China proxy server is the ideal way to access content that is region locked to China. You’ll be able to read local news or even set up a WeChat account as if you were a Chinese citizen. You can also use a Chinese proxy server to access local prices or scrape local data.

Anyone can use a China proxy, but you need to be careful about Chinese IP addresses. A proxy server won’t grant you total anonymity online. If you commit any crimes while accessing the internet through a China proxy server, law enforcement agencies can still track you down. Your IP address is only one piece of data that they will use to identify you.

If you connect to the internet through a China proxy, you’ll look like a Chinese citizen. Each of these providers offers a secure and reliable connection and a large IP pool to draw from. If one IP address gets blocked, you can quickly rotate to another one. A strong proxy provider will let you access to localized content while also enabling you to scrape local content for market intelligence. Whatever your reasons, if you need to access the internet with a Chinese IP address, then the CN proxy providers on this list are the best choices available.
