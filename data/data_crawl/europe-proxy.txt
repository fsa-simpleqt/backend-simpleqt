To identify the best European proxy provider, we ran extensive technical tests. We measured proxy speed, their ability to access local websites, and how well they work under high loads. We also checked if you’ll be able to specify your desired locations in Europe. The list includes only residential IPs because they offer better location coverage and are much harder to spot than datacenter proxies.

Our second focus was the provider’s ease of use, features for different tasks, and the quality of customer support.

Put together, these criteria allowed us to choose the very best European proxy services.

Just about any internet-capable device can connect to the internet through a proxy network. In fact, you’ll usually be able to configure your proxy connections on an application-by-application basis, enabling you to set different applications to connect through different proxy IP addresses.

Each provider’s documentation will vary and the setup processes might differ. But all them will route your connections through proxy servers located in Europe.

There is no shortage of free proxy services out there. But as tempting as they might be, you should really avoid them.

You don’t know who’s behind a free proxy service — such providers have been known to spy on users and intercept their data. If they wanted, a proxy server operator could wait for you to log in to an online banking or social media account and then harvest your credentials.

All of the providers on our list use the HTTPS protocol, ensuring that your communications with the proxy are encrypted. You should be aware that both Oxylabs and Bright Data track their users for legal reasons, so they might not be the best choice for everyone.

With a European IP address, you’ll be able to access the internet as if you were located within the EU.

This means you can reach local content, order goods (such as sneakers), and take advantage of prices and offers that are only available to customers in Europe. A European proxy server also lets you open multiple social media accounts and scrape data as if you were a local, which is invaluable for market intelligence.

Definitely! Using a European proxy to get an EU IP address is perfectly legal and something that anyone is free to do. If you are in doubt about the legality of using proxies where you live, you should consult with a local attorney.

Note that contrary to popular belief, using a proxy doesn’t make you untraceable and isn’t a magic shield for criminals. An IP address is just one piece of data that law enforcement can use to track internet users — disguising yours won’t prevent you from being identified.

Yes. Using a proxy service with a residential IP address is the best way to access local content and collect data from websites in Europe. Whatever you plan on doing with your European proxy, the providers above can give you a stress-free and reliable service. Every one of them can offer a stable, reliable, and secure connection. Their large IP pools also ensure that you can work uninterrupted by IP blocks.
