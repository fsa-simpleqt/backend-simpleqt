To determine the five best US residential proxy service providers, we analyzed key technical metrics and measured overall performance. We tested the connection speed for a number of providers along with their proxy success rate. We also measured if the proxy network can withstand high loads.

The end result? The five providers listed above performed the best. While the metrics varied between the providers, the results were clear. All five offer stable and reliable connections that allow you to access US-based content without restrictions.

Why residential proxies? They give you an IP address of real people and not servers in data centers. That’s why they’re often safer and always much harder to detect.

Using a US proxy server is easier than you might think. Proxy services work with practically all devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and other mobile devices. They also are compatible with virtually any web browser.

Most are simple enough to set up in just a few minutes. While the documentation for a particular proxy service may differ, any of the five US proxy providers will route your connections through the United States.

You can find plenty of US proxy online, but using them is very risky. First and foremost, many are slow and experience large periods of downtime. They are also insecure, and owners of such proxy services or third parties can steal your personal data.

All five proxy providers on this list offer secure HTTPS protocol to keep your data safe. While Bright Data and Oxylabs actually track and record user activity for legal reasons, the others on this list do not monitor your activity. At least they don’t specify doing so.

The most common reason for wanting a US proxy is to go around geo-blocking and firewalls that block non-US access to websites and content.

You may also want to create and manage multiple Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, or other social media accounts and make it seem as if they are in the US.

Buying multiple sneaker pairs for reselling is another very common use.

Or you may want to scrape American websites to get local data for ad verification, SEO, product information, or other purposes. US proxies will be able to help you in all of these scenarios.

Absolutely! Anybody can take advantage of a US proxy server to access content in the country. In most countries, using proxy services is legal. But if you’re in doubt about the legality in your own country, consult with an attorney to make sure.

Just know that the use of proxies does not protect you from legal action if you commit a crime. Not only can law enforcement find you through other means other than your IP address, but some proxies record and may give browser data to local authorities in need. Don’t be afraid to contact the proxy provider to ask about their stance in similar scenarios.

Accessing local content is one of the main reasons people use a US proxy server in the first place. Whether it’s specific entertainment, news outlets or social media, you’ll have all the flexibility that an actual US resident would have in browsing these websites. Other common reasons for using US proxies are to conduct market intelligence, research competitors, and scrape content. No matter your use case, a US proxy chosen from our list will let you consume and collect the content you need.
